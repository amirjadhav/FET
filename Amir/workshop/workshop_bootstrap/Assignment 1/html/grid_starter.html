          The word "kitten" derives from the Middle English word kitoun, which
          in turn came from the Old French chitoun or cheton.[1] Juvenile big
          cats are called "cubs" rather than kittens; either term (but usually
          more commonly "kitten") may be used for the young of smaller wild
          felids, such as ocelots, caracals, and lynxes.[2] A feline litter
          usually consists of two to five kittens[3] born after a gestation
          lasting between 64 and 67 days, with an average length of 66 days,[3]
          but from one to more than ten are known.[4] Kittens emerge in a sac
          called the amnion, which is bitten off and eaten by the mother cat.[5]

          Puppies are born with a fully functional sense of smell. They are
          unable to open their eyes. During their first two weeks, a puppy's
          senses all develop rapidly. During this stage the nose is the primary
          sense organ used by puppies to find their mother's teats, and to
          locate their littermates, if they become separated by a short
          distance. Puppies open their eyes about nine to eleven days following
          birth. At first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision
          is poor. Puppies are not able to see as well as adult dogs. In
          addition, puppies' ears remain sealed until about thirteen to
          seventeen days after birth, after which they respond more actively to
          sounds. Between two and four weeks old, puppies usually begin to
          growl, bite, wag their tails, and bark.[6]

          Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order
          Lagomorpha (along with the hare and the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus
          includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's
          305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit
          species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European
          rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except
          Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and
          as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread
          effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many
          areas of the world, a part of daily lifeâ€”as food, clothing, a
          companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.
